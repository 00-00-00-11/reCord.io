# reCord
A discord bot built with [discord.io](https://github.com/izy521/discord.io) API for NodeJS.

The premise of this bot is to do everything that most others can, but with some added unique features, namely, voice record functionality and some other related features, such as upcoming voice control.

Interesting features:
- Persistent music progress bar [âœ”]
- Has attitude toward other bots [-]
- Voice control [Upcoming]
- Records voice [Upcoming]
- Parrots other users [Upcoming]
- Plays Google Feud [Upcoming]
- Web control panel [Upcoming]

Still early stages which is why code is so messy (I'm also a beginner), and unstable.

On release I plan to add an easy-to-use GUI installer so you can run your own instance of reCord, or add my instance to your server, albeit with limited reCord functionality.
